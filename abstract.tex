\remark{
desired takebacks:
\itemize{
    \item available manpower to provide end-user software is limited
    \item hierarchical module naming scheme is the way to go
    \item avoid manual software installation and creation of module files (tedious) with EasyBuild
    \item required Lmod to allow users to easily 'navigate'
    \itemize{
        \item module spider for looking beyond the current \$MODULEPATH
        \item module swap + deactivation of modules
    }
    \item synergy between EasyBuild \& Lmod
    \item community-driven development of both tools
}
}
