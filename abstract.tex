HPC user support teams invest a lot of time and effort in installing scientific
software for their users. A well-established practice is providing module files,
with the intention to make it easy for users to set up their working environment.
Several problems remain however: user support teams lack appropriate tools to
maintain a scientific software stack easily and consistently, and users still
struggle to set up their working environment correctly.
In this paper, we present a modern approach to installing (scientific) software which
provides a solution to these common issues. We show how EasyBuild, a software
build and installation framework, can be used to automatically install software
and generate module files.  By using a hierarchical module naming
scheme to offer module files to users in a more structured way and providing Lmod,
a modern tool for working with modules, we avoid many of the common mistakes made
by users while retaining the flexibility required by power users.
