HPC user support teams invest a lot of time and effort in installing scientific
software for their users. A well-established practice is providing module files,
with the intention to make it easy for users to set up their working environment.
Several problems remain however: user support teams lack appropriate tools to maintain a
scientific software stack consistently, users still struggle to set up their working
environment correctly, etc.
In this paper we present a modern approach to installing scientific software, which provides
a solution to these commonly problems. We show how EasyBuild, a software build and
installation framework, can be used to fully automate the installation of scientific software.
By using a hierarchical module naming scheme to offer module files to users in a more structured
way and providing Lmod, a modern tool for working with modules, we avoid many of the common
mistakes made by users while retaining the flexibility required by power users.
