Although the latest versions of both \easybuild{} and Lmod already provide
flexible support for hierarchical module naming schemes, further enhancements can
be made to extend the capabilities and improve the user experience. We discuss
a couple of these which were not resolved yet at the time of writing.

The latest available version of \easybuild{} to date only supports generating
module files in Tcl syntax, while module files in Lua syntax are required to use
some of the advanced features that Lmod supports, e.g., defining properties and
families. This particular feature is already being implemented by members of the
\easybuild{} community.

Although the required support is available, a deeper module hierarchy that
better matches the toolchain concept in \easybuild{} should be worked out.
Usually, only the \texttt{Compiler} and \texttt{MPI} hierarchy levels are used,
while \easybuild{} toolchains can also include math libraries. Extending
the two-level hierarchy to capture this aspect is not straightforward however,
since BLAS/LAPACK/FFT functionality can be provided by one single library (e.g.,
Intel MKL), or by multiple distinct libraries (e.g., OpenBLAS, LAPACK and FFTW).
This complicates the design of a deeper hierarchy that supports swapping one
math library for one or multiple others providing the same functionality.

Related to this, a concept currently not supported yet by Lmod is a
multi-dimensional hierarchy, often referred to as `matrix`.

Another improvement to \easybuild{} would be making the dependency resolution
mechanism aware of subtoolchains. When \texttt{eb} checks the availability of
modules that match the required dependencies, it uses the toolchain selected
for the software being installed (unless this is overridden specifically on a
per-dependency basis). This requires that modules which are for example only
dependent on a compiler are built and installed multiple times with different
toolchain, even though they're providing the same software builds, which yields
more modules than required and consumes additional disk space. Also checking for
modules which were installed with a compatible subtoolchain, e.g. providing onl
the compiler and MPI library, allows that these tools are installed only once.

\ignore{
Furthermore, both \easybuild{} and Lmod need to be evaluated on, and possibly
ported to, special-purpose systems like Cray and IBM BlueGene. Preliminary
experiments are promising since they only reveal mostly minor issues on these
type of systems. On Cray systems for example, some care has to be taken in order
to be able to use the provided \texttt{ProgEnv} modules that wrap around the
different readily available compilers. One concept that is currently not well
supported yet by \easybuild{} is cross-compilation, in which software is built
for a particular type of system which is different than the one of which the build
is performed. This significantly complicates the running of tests, as is often
done by build configuration scripts.
