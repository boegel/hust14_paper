\subsection{Lmod: easy software access without hindering experts}

Lmod is a modern tool for consuming module files, with a strong focus on providing users
easy access to their (scientific) software stack, without hindering experts. It is the
handshake between the system administrators and end users, and delivers a powerful yet
flexible way of configuring and managing their working software stack. Lmod is feature-rich,
well supported, continously enhanced, and comes with a vibrant
community.   This talk will cover the main concepts in a module
system, the choice of module layout (hierarchical vs. flat),  The
new features of Lmod and and how to leverage the module system to
track how which software package user use and do not use.
