Sites like TACC use an in-house developed tool called
LosF~\cite{lmodSC11} to leverage in-house  built RPMS.  The spec files
that control the RPMS are parameterized so that one spec file can be
used to the plethora of versions required.  The site build RPMS
include the modulefile.  Therefore installing the package installs the
modulefile and removing the package removes the modulefile.
